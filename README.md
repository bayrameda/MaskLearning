## Mask Learning

This is the impementation of "Mask Combination of Multi-layer Graphs for Global Structure Inference", Bayram et al.

It requires [CVX: Matlab Software for Disciplined Convex Programming](http://cvxr.com/cvx/). We used SDPT3 and MOSEK solvers supported by CVX. The necessary information for the installations can be found [here](http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html).
